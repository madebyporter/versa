  This past year, I've been learning JamStack. It's basically a secure,
  efficient way to launch a static website. 


  The stack consists of Javascript, API and Markup. Go learn those three things,
  then come back and learn some Jamstack!


  By the way, this site was built using a Jamstack of Middleman, Javascript,
  APIs and Markup!

      With Jamstack comes to management of content. You can't use Wordpress with
      this, which is good. Headless CMS means the CMS database is separate from
      the app.
